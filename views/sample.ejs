Like being in the know but not spending all that time reading to be in the know? TL;DR: Automated Summaries can help!

TL;DR takes all of the important stuff out of those drawn out novels you're trying to read. Simply feed TL;DR the content and how much you want to know, and it'll spit out all you need to know. Ya know?

If knowledge is power, and time is valuable, then TL;DR is powerfully valuable.
